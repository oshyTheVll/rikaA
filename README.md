# rikaA
discord slur filter with your own discord bot token.

download the .zip with the three files inside
the rikaA.js is the code for the filter and you can add any other bad word you want in the 43 line.

and you need to put your discord bot token in the .env file

and finally the .bat file launches rikaA.js but you need to copy the rikaA.js path and put it inside.

1. copy rikaA.js path (right click on it and copy path)
2. open .bat with notepad or whatever you like 
3. you gonna see "Your-rikaA.js-path-here" select it all and paste your path

hope you like it..
